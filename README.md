# WEB-BASED-CHATBOT-USING-FLASK-APIIn 
this Python web-based project with source code, we are going to build a chatbot using deep learning and flask techniques. The chatbot will be trained on the dataset which contains categories (intents), pattern and responses. We use a special artificial neural network (ANN) to classify which category the userâ€™s message belongs to and then we will give a random response from the list of responses.

chatbot using Flask, NLTK, Keras, Python, etc.
