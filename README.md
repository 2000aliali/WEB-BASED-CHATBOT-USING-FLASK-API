# WEB-BASED-CHATBOT-USING-FLASK-APIIn 
this Python web-based project with source code, we are going to build a chatbot using deep learning and flask techniques. The chatbot will be trained on the dataset which contains categories (intents), pattern and responses. We use a special artificial neural network (ANN) to classify which category the user’s message belongs to and then we will give a random response from the list of responses.

chatbot using Flask, NLTK, Keras, Python, etc.


The dataset we will be using is ‘data.json’. This is a JSON file that contains the patterns we need to find and the responses we want to return to the user.

The project requires you to have good knowledge of Python, Keras, and Natural language processing (NLTK). Along with them, we will use some helping modules which you can download using the python-pip command.

#pip install tensorflow 
#pip install keras 
#pip install pickle
#pip install nltk
#pip install flask
