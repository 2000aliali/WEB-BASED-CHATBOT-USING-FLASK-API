# Web-Based Chatbot Using Flask API

This Python web-based project with source code demonstrates how to build a chatbot using deep learning and Flask techniques. The chatbot is trained on a dataset containing categories (intents), patterns, and responses. It utilizes an artificial neural network (ANN) to classify the user's message category and provides a random response from a list of responses.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Keras

## Project Overview

The heart of this project is the `data.json` file, which contains predefined patterns and responses. We use this data to train our chatbot. The project involves using Python, Keras, and Natural Language Processing (NLTK) along with some additional modules.

To get started, make sure to install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
